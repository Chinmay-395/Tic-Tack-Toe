# what are React-hooks
    Hooks are a new feature addition in React version 16.8 which allow
    you to use React features without having to write a class.  
## Rules of Hooks
    1. Only call Hooks at the Top Level
      ==> Don't call Hooks inside loops,conditions or nested function
    2. Only call Hooks from React Functions
      ==> Call them from within React functional components and not just any 
          regular javaScript function


### useState Hooks
   A `useState` hook allows you to add state to a functional component.
   The hook returns a tuple where the first parameter is the current state
    of the counter and setCount is the method that will allow us
    to update the counter's state.
